# Nonogram-Solver
I play Nonogram daily and I am wondering how hard it would be to code something that would solve it. 

So with something like this:
![example board](./Example%20Board.png)




the input would be: ( Note the 0 is supposed to be 10)\
1,41,44,212,121,24,521,44,33,11\
4\
23\
12\
0\
25\
111\
23\
13\
22\
44\
